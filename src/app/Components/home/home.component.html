                <h2>WHY 619?</h2>
                <p> After the revolution, the economic situation fell short of expectations. Slower growth, persistent unemployment and inequalities, lower investments, sale of Tunisian products. All these elements reflect the magnitude of the challenges to be met.
                    Tunisia still has challenges to take up to ensure economic recovery and social peace, in particular through public finance reforms, an improvement in the business climate or measures to reduce inequalities and unemployment, increase sales of Tunisian products with the implementation of new sales strategies.

                <h2> NEW LIFE FOR THE ECONOMY </h2>
                <p>The depreciation of the dinar is due to the deterioration of our economic fundamentals.
                    This subject affects every Tunisian, in particular our weak economy, it is therefore imperative that we inform each other about the priority of local consumption, which will improve our country. 
                    Any Tunisian company subject to Tunisian law, all its products put the bar code # 619, which gives it the Tunisian Numbering Company of the Ministry of Commerce. To be a Tunisian company that offers 100% Tunisian products, it must contribute at least 40% of its turnover to Tunisian trade, so the company becomes 100% Tunisian.
